Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
Output:
8
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
and 8th number is 8.

def findNthNaturalNumber(N):
    result = 0
    base = 1

    while N > 0:
        result += base * (N % 9)
        N //= 9
        base *= 10

    return result

# Example usage:
N = 8
result = findNthNaturalNumber(N)
print(result)  # Output: 8
